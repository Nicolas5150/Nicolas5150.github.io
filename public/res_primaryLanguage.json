My main priotrites include helping our designers + engineers have an easier work experience. I help build products that assit them - whether it be by creating documetnation sites that thousands of employees see every day, or dedicated tools specific to a team. Prior to my front-end role, I was a design technologist for several years. This role was had me at the intersection of Sr UX designers and engineers. I created several multi-phased, high-fidelity web protoypes to help our teams gain confidence from leadership and our end users. Many of these protoypes ultimatley helped drive what is seen on the Seller Central site today!",
